# Welcome to the Added Optional Features of the DDLC Mod Template!

This section contains all optional code you can use in your mod that was previously bundled with the template (under `mod_extras`) but now separated to return back to the original template aesthetic. 

## Installation
For most code here, all you need to do is copy the respective feature files inside their folders to your projects' game folder. Everything should work out of the box once you run DDLC again.
> If a file requires additional steps, please refer to its' own README file.

## Contents
