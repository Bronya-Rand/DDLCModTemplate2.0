    n "But when you click New Game, the music stops progressively."
    n 5a "That's due to {i}stop music fadeout 2.0{/i}. {i}stop music{/i} tells the current music to stop. {i}fadeout 2.0{/i} makes it so the current music completely becomes silent in 2 seconds."

    y 3d "Now it's Monika who finally realized that I'm the best one for you."
    y 3n "Oh! We drifted a bit...So I was saying that you need to specify two things to type a dialogue in Ren'Py."
    y 3a "First you need to specify who is speaking. You can do it with the keywords {i}mc{/i}, {i}y{/i}, {i}n{/i}, {i}s{/i} and {i}m{/i}. I'm sure you can guess who is who."
    y "Instead of using keyword, you can directly type the name of the person speaking. For example, try writing {i} \"Player\" \"Is this just me writing a diary?\"{/i}."
    y 2f "Did you do it?"
    y "You got the same result if you were using {i}mc{/i} instead."
    y 2a "Besides the name of the speaker, you need to type the sentence they will say. The sentence should be between quotation marks."
    y 1j "One last thing. If you want to type special characters such as {i}\\{/i} or {i}\"{/i} in a sentence, you need to put {i}\\{/i} before them."
    y 1d "Alright, that's all for dialogue!"
    y 1b "Pretty simple, right? Ren'Py was made so that anyone can make visual novel after all. Even beginners like us can pick it up quickly."

    m 2a "Save the file and try to play the game."
    m 5a "If it doesn't work, you know where you can see the answer, don't you?"
    m 2a "You already know how scene, transition, music and dialogue work so I won't go over it again."
    m 4b "It's not like I don't want spend more time with you but you know, ... I'm excited to finish my route too!"
    m 4a "Okay, so the new thing is the {i}if{/i} statement. We call that a conditional statement. It's an elementary and essential operation in programming."
    m "It goes basically like this: IF something is true THEN something happens. In our case, if the meeting place is {i}club_room{/i} then the scene changes to the clubroom."
    m 3a "Otherwise, if the meeting place is {i}my_house{/i} then the scene changes to the main character's house."
    m 3b "It seems simple, right?"
    m 3a "The syntax must be as follow: first, there must be a {i}if{/i} followed by an equality which is either {i}True{/i} or {i}False{/i}. For example, {i}meeting_place == \"club_room\"{/i}."
    m "If {i}meeting_place{/i} was assigned {i}club_room{/i} before then the equality returns {i}True{/i}. Otherwise, its returns {i}False{/i}."
    m "If the equality returns {i}True{/i} then the game will read the lines belonging to the {i}if{/i} block."
    m 4a "You can see where those lines are because they have one more indent compared to the if statement preceding them."
    m 4b "We once again meet the system of indent and block. This is one of the property of Python and Ren'Py. Let's do a quick exercise."
    m "Can you see difference between:"
    m 2a "{i}if meeting_place == \"club_room\":{/i}   \n{i}        scene bg club_day{/i} \n{i}        mc \"We will meet at the club room.\"{/i}"
    m "And {i}if meeting_place == \"club_room\":{/i}   \n{i}        scene bg club_day{/i}\n{i}mc \"We will meet at the club room.\"{/i}"
    m 4b "In the first case, the main character only says they will meet at the club room if {i}meeting_place{/i} is equal to {i}club_room{/i}."
    m "In the second case, he will say it no matter the value of {i}meeting_place{/i}."
    m 3a "You can see once again how important indentations are in Python."
    m 4b "About the second comparison, {i}elif meeting_place == \"my_house\"{/i}, note that we use {i}elif{/i} at the beginning instead of {i}if{/i}."
    m 4a "The difference between {i}elif{/i} and {i}if{/i} is subtle. First, you can only use {i}elif{/i} after you already wrote {i}if{/i}."
    m "Second, the statement following {i}elif{/i} won't be evaluated if the previous if statement was {i}True{/i}. Other than that, {i}elif{/i} works like {i}if{/i}."
    m 1b "Well, in our case it doesn't matter because if {i}meeting_place{/i} is {i}club_room{/i} then {i}meeting_place{/i} cannot be {i}my_house{/i} at the same time."
    m 1a "It would matter if it was something like..."
    m "{i}if monika_affection_points > 10:{/i} \n{i}        scene bg house{/i} \n{i}if monika_affection_points > 6:{/i}   \n{i}        scene club_day{/i}"
    m 3a "In that case, if {i}monika_affection_points{/i} is higher than 10, the new scene wouldn't be the house but the club because the game will evaluate both if."
    m 4b "To avoid that, {i}elif{/i} should be used instead of {i}if{/i}."
    m 4a "Besides {i}if{/i} and {i}elif{/i}, there's also the keyword {i}else{/i}. Like {i}elif{/i}, {i}else{/i} can be used after a {i}if{/i}. The block under {i}else{/i} will be executed if the previous {i}if{/i} or {i}elif{/i} statements are {i}False{/i}."
    m 2a "For example..."
    m "{i}if meeting_place == \"club_room\":{/i} \n{i}        scene bg club_day{/i} \n{i}else:{/i}   \n{i}scene club_day{/i}."
    m 1a "Well, there are more things to say about conditional statement..."
    m "For example about the keywords {i}and{/i} and {i}or{/i}..."
    m 3a "But let's keep that for another time. I'm sure you can find more tutorial on Python and conditional statement."

    m 4b "Alright! The only new things are {i}show monika 1b at t11 zorder 2{/i} and {i}m 2a{/i}."
    m 4a "First, let's go over {i}show monika 1b at t11 zorder 2{/i}."

    m 3b "I'll explain how positions and layers work in the next tutorial. For now, let's focus on the poses and expressions of sprite."
    m 4a "Obviously, the variable {i}monika{/i} refers to me. Naturally, {i}yuri{/i} refers to Yuri and so on."
    m "If you type {i}show yuri 1b at f11 zorder 3{/i} instead of {i}show monika 1b at f11 zorder 3{/i}, it's Yuri who will appear."
    m 4k "Of course, you only have eyes for me so let's not bother with the sprites of the other girls, ahaha!"

    m 5a "Like this."

    m 4a "My other poses have all expressions though."
    m 1b "Okay! In short, to show a sprite, you need to type {i}show monika pose expression at t11 zorder 2{/i}. Pose is either {i}1,2,3,4 or 5{/i} and expression ranges from {i}a{/i} to {i}r{/i}."
    m "If you want to show several characters, just type {i}show{/i} several times, like this:"

    m 2b "These lines will show Yuri, Sayori, me and Natsuki with their default pose and expression."
    m "After a sprite is already on the screen, there's a shortcut to change her pose and expression."
    m 3a "Instead of using {i}show{/i} again and again, you can directly type the letter corresponding to the character followed by the number and the letter for their pose and expression."
    m "This is what we did in {i}m 2a \"Don't worry, it's me who's early.\"{/i}."
    m 4g "Note that the sprite of the character speaking must already be on screeen."
    m 4e "If you try for example \ny 2a \"Don't worry, it's me who's early.\", Yuri will speak but her sprite will not appear."
    m 3a "Keep in mind who's on screen and who's not at all time so as not to make a mistake."
    m 2a "...Never mind, actually just show my sprite. That way you don't have to worry about such problem. It's not like the other girls care about being shown anyway."

    m 1b "And that's all for the {i}t{/i} positions."
    m 4a "I think you guessed it already but {i}t11{/i} should be used when there's only one character."
    m "{i}t21{/i} and {i}t22{/i} should be used when there are two characters. {i}t21{/i} is for the left, {i}t22{/i} is for the right."
    m 3a "It's the same logic for {i}t31{/i},{i}t32{/i},{i}t33{/i}. {i}t31{/i} is the left, {i}t32{/i} the middle and {i}t33{/i} the right. "
    m "{i}t41{/i}, {i}t42{/i},{i}t43{/i} and {i}t44{/i} work in the same way."
    m 3b "I encourage you to try these positions yourself with several characters. After all, there's nothing better than practice to learn!"
    m 1a "If you remember well, we wrote one time {i}show yuri 1b at f11 zorder 3{/i}."
    m "Notice that the position is {i}f11{/i} instead of {i}t11{/i}. The difference is just that {i}f{/i} positions are zoomed in. {i}f{/i} stands for focused. There are as many {i}f{/i} positions as {i}t{/i} positions."
    m 4a "You should use {i}f{/i} position when there are several characters and when one of them speaks. The character speaking should be focused so that the player sees who's talking."
    m 2b "Let's talk about the keyword {i}zorder{/i} now."
    m 4a "When the game renders pictures, there's an order."

    m 4b "That's why the sprites are on top of the background and the U.I on top of everything."
    m 2a "As you can see, order is very important. If the game renders background last, then you won't be able to see anything else."
    m 3a "In Ren'Py the order of sprite is called {i}zorder{/i}."
    m "You can specify the zorder of each sprite with the keyword zorder. The higher it is, the closer the sprite will be to the screen."
