  <h1>DDLC Mod Template Help</h1>
  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <p><em>
    The new DDLC Mod Template is a Doki Doki Literature Club mod template that is not affiliated in anyway with Team Salvato. It is designed to be used only after the official game has been completed. You can download Doki Doki Literature Club at: <a href=http://ddlc.moe>http://ddlc.moe</a> or Steam.
  </em></p>
  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>
    The files in this DDLC Mod Template alter Doki Doki Literature Club. You must have an installation of DDLC, which can be downloaded for free from <a href=http://ddlc.moe>http://ddlc.moe</a> or Steam.
  </p>
  <p>
    To install, copy all the files in this ZIP folder into the <tt>game</tt> folder in your DDLC folder. This replaces the scripts for the original game. Opening Doki Doki Literature Club will now load with all of the modified files.
  </p>
  <h3>Windows (Steam Release)</h3>
  <p>
    If you are running DDLC on Steam, you can access the game files by right-clicking the game in your Library, then selecting <tt>Properties</tt>. In the <tt>Local Files</tt> tab, click the <tt>Browse local files...</tt> button. This will open a window with the game directory.
  </p>
  <h3>macOS (OS X)</h3>
  <p>
    Mac users can access the game directory by right-clicking on the DDLC application and selecting <tt>Show Package Contents</tt>. Then, the game directory can be found in <tt>Contents/Resources/autorun</tt>.
  </p>
  <h2>Uninstall</h2>
  <p>
    To restore DDLC, either remove the mod template files or re-download DDLC on <a href=http://ddlc.moe>http://ddlc.moe</a> or Steam.
  </p>
  <h2>Basic Help</h2>
  <p>
    To advance through the game, <tt>left-click</tt> or press the <tt>space</tt> or <tt>enter</tt> keys. When at a menu,
    <tt>left-click</tt> to make a choice, or use the arrow keys to select a choice and <tt>enter</tt> to activate it.
  </p>

  <h3>Game Menu</h3>
  <p>
    When playing a game, press the <tt>escape</tt> key to enter the game menu. The game menu
    gives the following choices:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Return</dt>
    <dd>Returns to the game.</dd>
    <dt>Save Game</dt>
    <dd>Allows you to save a game by clicking on a save slot.</dd>
    <dt>Load Game</dt>
    <dd>Allows you to load a game by clicking on a save slot. Clicking on "Auto" accesses the automatic save slots.</dd>
    <dt>Preferences</dt>
    <dd>
      Changes the game preferences (options/configuration):
      <dl>
        <dt>Display</dt>
        <dd>Switches between fullscreen and windowed mode.</dd>
        <dt>Text Speed</dt>
        <dd>Controls the rate at which text displays. The further to the right this slider is, the faster the text
          will display. All the way to the right causes text to be shown instantly.</dd>
        <dt>Skip - Unseen Text</dt>
        <dd>Chooses between skipping messages that have been already seen (in any play through the game), and
          skipping all messages.</dd>
        <dt>Skip - After Choices</dt>
        <dd>Controls if skipping stops upon reaching a menu.</dd>
        <dt>Auto-Forward Time</dt>
        <dd>Controls automatic advance. The further to the left this slider is, the shorter the amount of time
          before the game advances. All the way to the right means text will never auto-forward.</dd>
        <dt>Music and Sound Volume</dt>
        <dd>Controls the volume of the Music and Sound effect channels, respectively. The further to the
          right these are, the louder the volume.</dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>

  <h2>Loading and Deleting Save Data</h2>
  <p>
    Some mods may offer the option to load some or all of your data from a previous mod playthrough. If so, that option will be presented on the first load of the game, after the initial content warning and disclaimer.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do choose to load previous data, the original mod save data will not be changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases, you may want to delete your save data to start the game completely over. To do this, navigate to the <tt>%APPDATA%/RenPy</tt> folder, double-click the folder of the mod and delete the files located in it and launch DDLC again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deleting save data for a mod will not alter or delete original save data from DDLC.
