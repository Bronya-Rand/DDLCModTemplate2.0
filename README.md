# Welcome to the New Modification Club!

The DDLC Mod Template 2.0 is a Mod Template for Doki Doki Literature Club by GanstaKingofSA that adhere to the [Team Salvato IP Guidelines](http://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines/) for fan mods.

### Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the template.

1. Download and run the [Ren'Py 6.99.12 SDK](https://www.renpy.org/release/6.99.12). *(NOTE: DDLC does not work with `.rpyc` files generated with other versions of the Ren'Py SDK)*
2. Go to releases to download the [latest build](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDLCModTemplate2.0/releases) of the template.
3. Place the files in the Ren'Py working directory (default is the `renpy-6.99.12.4-sdk` folder).
4. Download the DDLC files, available for free at http://ddlc.moe or Steam ('Steam/steamapps/common/Doki Doki Literature Club') & drop the `audio.rpa`, `images.rpa`, and `fonts.rpa` files from it into the /game directory. (Do **not** include the `scripts.rpa` file, as this will create conflicts.)
5. Launch the project in Ren'Py. It should compile & run.
6. Navigate the Ren'Py menu & select "Build Distributions." Check "DDLC Compatible Mod" and build the mod. This will create a cross-platform .ZIP file with files for the mod & installation instructions.

### Template Features
1. Build Packaging! Distribute cross-platform mods with ease thanks to Ren'Py.
2. Mod Installation Instructions & Guide! Run the game to get a short introduction by Monika!
3. Splash Screen on First Load. This adheres to the Team Salvato guidelines for creating fan mods of the game.
4. Remastered RPY's to be exact replicas of DDLC's with explainations.
5. Customizable! Use this as a starting point for any ideas you wish to create.
6. Xcode Support! Open this project in Xcode and you can edit, build, and run your mod without opening Ren'Py Launcher ever again! 
> Note: You need to change your `RENPY_TOOL` location and the Ren'Py app location in the target scheme for Xcode. [Learn more &rsaquo;](XCODE.md)
