# Welcome to the Modification Club!

The Re-Vamped DDLC Mod Template is a remastered version of the DDLC Mod Template from the Monika After Story Team for Doki Doki Literature Club that adhere to the [Team Salvato IP Guidelines](http://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines/) for fan mods.

### Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the template.

1. Download and install the [Ren'Py SDK version 6.99.12](https://www.renpy.org/release/6.99.12). *(NOTE: The current version of DDLC is not compatible with .rpyc files generated with other versions of the Renpy SDK)*
2. Go to releases to download the [latest stable build](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDLCModTemplate2.0/releases).
3. Place the files in the Ren'Py working directory (chosen during installation).
4. Download the DDLC files, available for free at http://ddlc.moe or Steam ('Steam/steamapps/common/Doki Doki Literature Club') & drop the `audio.rpa`, `images.rpa`, and `fonts.rpa` files from it into the /game directory. (Do **not** include the `scripts.rpa` file, as this will create conflicts.)
5. Launch the project in Ren'Py. It should compile & run.
6. Navigate the Ren'Py menu & select "Build Distributions." Check "DDLC Compatible Mod" and build the mod. This will create a cross-platform .ZIP file with files for the mod & installation instructions.
