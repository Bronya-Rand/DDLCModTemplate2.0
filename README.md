### Getting Started for Beginners and for Ren'Py 6
Follow these steps to set up the template.

1. Download and run the [Ren'Py 6.99.12 SDK](https://www.renpy.org/release/6.99.12). **(NOTE: DDLC does not work with newer Ren'Py versions unless upgraded)**
2. Go to releases to download the [latest build](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDLCModTemplate2.0/releases) of the template.
3. Place the files inside a folder (preferrably your mod name or `game`) where you extracted Ren'Py to inside of `renpy-6.99.12.4-sdk`.

4. Download the DDLC files, available for free at http://ddlc.moe or Steam & drop the `audio.rpa`, `images.rpa`, `fonts.rpa`, and `scripts.rpa` files inside the ZIP under DDLC-1.1.1-pc/game into the /game directory of where you made your template folder.

5. Launch the project in Ren'Py. It should compile & run.
6. Navigate the Ren'Py menu & select "Build Distributions." Check "Ren'Py 6 DDLC Compliant Mod" and build the mod. This will create a cross-platform .ZIP file with files for the mod & installation instructions.

### Getting Started for Advanced Users for Ren'Py 7
1. Download and run the [Ren'Py 7.3.5 SDK](https://www.renpy.org/release/7.3.5) **(NOTE: Any files built in this version is incompatible with Ren'Py 6)**
2. Go to releases to download the [latest build](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDLCModTemplate2.0/releases) of the template.
3. Place the files inside a folder (preferrably your mod name or `game`) where you extracted Ren'Py to inside of `renpy-7.3.5-sdk`.
4. Download the DDLC files, available for free at http://ddlc.moe or Steam & drop the `audio.rpa`, `images.rpa`, `fonts.rpa`, and `scripts.rpa` files inside the ZIP under DDLC-1.1.1-pc/game into the /game directory of where you made your template folder.
5. Launch the project in Ren'Py. It should compile & run.
6. Navigate the Ren'Py menu & select "Build Distributions." Check "Ren'Py 7 DDLC Compliant Mod" and build the mod. This will create a cross-platform .ZIP file with files for the mod & installation instructions.
7. Please add this install snipbit to your post for others to install your mod to DDLC properly. This is a example.
> To install DDLC MASR, copy all the files inside of the zip file to the game folder.
> If it asks you to replace any files, please replace and run the mod via DDLCMASR.exe instead of DDLC.exe
