The **new** DDLC Mod Template is a mod template for the **original** Doki Doki Literature Club by GanstaKingofSA that adheres to [Team Salvato's IP Guidelines](http://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines/) for fan mods. The last version the template was tested and working on Ren'Py <u>6.99.12.4</u> and <u>7.4.5</u>. 
> This mod template will not work for Doki Doki Literature Club Plus. Development of a mod template for Doki Doki Literature Club Plus will take some time to be done if it's possible to mod the game.

**The template is designed for Original DDLC fan games and mods that use DDLC assets. 
It is not meant for projects that does not use them, or as code to be copied to your non-DDLC project. 
Most code in this template are the IP of Team Salvato and may not be copied to non-DDLC fan projects or mods.**
