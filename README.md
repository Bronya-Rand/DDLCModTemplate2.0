The **new** DDLC Mod Template is a mod template made by Azariel Del Carmen (bronya_rand) for the **original** Doki Doki Literature Club that adheres to [Team Salvato's IP Guidelines](http://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines/) for fan mods on Ren'Py 6.99.12.4 and 7.3.5+.

> Additionaly [here](./CREDITS.md) are all the contributors that contributed to the mod template.

> For Ren'Py 8 support, see the [Python 3](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDLCModTemplate2.0/tree/python-3) branch.

### Disclaimers
   - <u>Team Salvato</u>
      > The template code/files are designed for original DDLC fan games and mods that use DDLC assets with Ren'Py. It is not meant for non-DDLC projects. The DDLC Mod Template is not afilliated in anyway with Team Salvato.
   - <u>bronya_rand</u>
      > You may not use the template to make unofficial DDLC patchers, fixes, etc.

### **Credit Requirements**
You must include a name credit in your mods' credits screen and/or `credits.txt` file. Below is a example credit you may use.
   > This mod was made possible by bronya_rand's DDLC Mod Template 2.0: https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDLCModTemplate2.0

By default a credits screen is enabled in-game, either in the Extras screen or as a button in-game if the Extras screen is disabled.

Optional but very appreciated credits that you can also add are
   1. A custom splash screen that features the Team Salvato logo (and/or your mod logo) and a `Bronya Rand` logo (which can be found [here](.github/IMAGES/Logos)).
   2. A small mention in the game's disclaimer saying that this mod was not possible without using bronya_rand's mod template.
   3. A presplash screen that contains a `Bronya Rand` logo (which can be found [here](.github/IMAGES/Logos)).
   4. Present a custom idea to me for approval either through Discord or Reddit.

### Template Features
1. Ren'Py 6* or 7 Team Salvato Compliant Mods and Splashscreen (Disclaimer)!
   > \* - Ren'Py 6 support will end soon to keep up with Ren'Py's Development Lifecycle. It is **highly** recommended you upgrade to Ren'Py 7 for mod development.
