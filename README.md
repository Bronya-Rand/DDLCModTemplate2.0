The **new** DDLC Mod Template is a mod template made by Azariel Del Carmen (GanstaKingofSA) for the **original** Doki Doki Literature Club that adheres to [Team Salvato's IP Guidelines](http://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines/) for fan mods on Ren'Py 6.99.12.4 and 7.3.5 - 7.5.3.

> Additionaly [here](./CREDITS.md) are all the contributors that contributed to the mod template.

> For Ren'Py 8 support, see the [Python 3](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDLCModTemplate2.0/tree/python-3) branch.

Optional but very appreciated credits that you can also add are
