# Welcome to the Modification Club!

The DDLC Mod Template Version 2 is a revamped version of the Monika After Story Team's DDLC Mod Template.
It was re-made using DDLC's files due to missing items from the original mod template and more clarification on items.

### Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the template.

1. Download and install the [Ren'Py SDK version 6.99.12](https://www.renpy.org/release/6.99.12). *(NOTE: The current version of DDLC is not compatible with .rpyc files generated with other versions of the Renpy SDK)*
2. Go to releases to download the [latest stable build](https://github.com/therationalpi/DDLCModTemplate/releases). For development builds, fork this repository or download the files by clicking the button labeled "Clone or Download" above.
3. Download the DDLC files (available for free at http://ddlc.moe), extract it & drop the Mod Template files in there.
3. Configure Ren'Py's Project Directory to where you have DDLC and the Mod Template Files.
4. Make the scripts, and add content to your mod in Ren'Py using Editra.
5. Launch the project in Ren'Py when done. It should compile & run.
6. Once your finished your mod, select "Build Distributions." Check "DDLC Compatible Mod" and build the mod. This will create a cross-platform .ZIP file with files for the mod & installation instructions.

### Template Features
1. Build Packaging. Distribute cross-platform mods with ease with Ren'Py.
2. Re-vamped Instructions from the base game content.
3. Splash screen on first load. This adheres to the Team Salvato guidelines for creating fan mods of the game.
4. Returned missing items from DDLC to the DDLC Mod Template.
5. Customizable! Use as a starting point for any ideas you wish to create.
