### Getting Started for Beginners (Ren'Py 6)

1. Download and run the [Ren'Py 6.99.12 SDK](https://www.renpy.org/release/6.99.12). **(NOTE: DDLC does not work with newer Ren'Py versions unless upgraded, see below.)**
2. Go to releases to download the [latest build](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDLCModTemplate2.0/releases) of the template.
3. Place the files inside a folder (preferrably your mod name or `game`) where you extracted Ren'Py to inside of `renpy-6.99.12.4-sdk`.
4. Download the DDLC files, available for free at http://ddlc.moe or Steam & paste `audio.rpa`, `images.rpa`, `fonts.rpa`, and `scripts.rpa` inside the ZIP under DDLC-1.1.1-pc/game or Doki Doki Literature Club/game (Steam) into the /game directory of where you made your template folder.
5. Launch the project in Ren'Py. It should launch the game.
6. Once you finished writing your script, navigate the Ren'Py menu & select "Build Distributions." Uncheck all and check "Ren'Py 6 DDLC Compliant Mod" and build the mod. This will create a cross-platform .ZIP file with files for your mod.

### Getting Started for Advanced Users (Ren'Py 7)
Follow these steps to set up the template for Ren'Py 7.

1. Download and run the [Ren'Py 7.3.5 SDK](https://www.renpy.org/release/7.3.5) **(NOTE: Any files built in this version is incompatible with Ren'Py 6)**
2. Go to releases to download the [latest build](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDLCModTemplate2.0/releases) of the template.
3. Place the files inside a folder (preferrably your mod name or `game`) where you extracted Ren'Py to inside of `renpy-7.3.5-sdk`.
4. Download the DDLC files, available for free at http://ddlc.moe or Steam & paste `audio.rpa`, `images.rpa`, `fonts.rpa`, and `scripts.rpa` inside the ZIP under DDLC-1.1.1-pc/game or Doki Doki Literature Club/game (Steam) into the /game directory of where you made your template folder.
5. Launch the project in Ren'Py. It should launch the game.
6. Once you finished writing your script, navigate the Ren'Py menu & select "Build Distributions." Uncheck all and check "Ren'Py 7 DDLC Compliant Mod" and build the mod. This will create a cross-platform .ZIP file with files for your mod.

### Getting Started For Android Porting/Modding
Refer to *guide.pdf* in your ZIP folder for more information but make sure of these key points.
1. Make sure that your package name in Ren'Py Launcher is the same as the package name you will use in `options.rpy`. Example: If your package name is named `com.yuri.storm`, your package name in Ren'Py Launcher under Android -> Configure must be `com.yuri.storm` as well. 
2. It is wise to only change `sdc` to your name and leave everything as is in `options.rpy` under `define package_name`. It will grab your mod name via `build.name` and `com` is common use in Android applications. i.e. `"com.sdc." + build.name.lower()` to `com.monika." + build.name.lower()`

More information about Android is listed in the Wiki or *guide.pdf*.
