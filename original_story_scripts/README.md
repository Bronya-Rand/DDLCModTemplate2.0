## Advanced scripts

These `.rpy` files are copies of the story script files found in DDLC's `script.rpa` archive.

These are offered as a reference, and if you don't include them in the `game/` folder for your mod, then the original version will be automatically loaded from DDLC's archives on startup. If you do create a `.rpy` file of the same name in your `game/` folder, then your version will be loaded instead.

This can be very useful if you wanted to mimic DDLC's storyline up to some point, then diverge. For example, if you wanted to follow the story up until Sayori's suicide, but then diverge into a what-if scenario where Sayori doesn't die, then you could add `script-ch5.rpy` to your game and edit it as needed.

**If you are not making changes to these files, please do not include them in the distribution for your mod.**
