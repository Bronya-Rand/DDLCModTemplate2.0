To start this mod on Linux, start the mod by running './LinuxLauncher.sh' (without quotes) instead
of running it via DDLC.sh or the mod's own SH file. This new SH file fixes a issue with mods running
on Linux due to a import error by old Ren'Py 6 files.

If you get a error with the SH file, make sure it's set to LF and not CRLF via a Text Editor.

That is all. Happy mod playing!
